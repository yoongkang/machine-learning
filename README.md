# Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree Projects

This is a repository of most of the projects, Jupyter Notebooks, code, etc. that I worked on throughout the course.

The only exception is the Deep Learning dog project which is in a different repository: https://github.com/yoongkang/dog-project (seemed a bit easier to put it separately)

Most of these projects are guided, but is quite valuable reference material.
